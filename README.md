# Web-Design-Challenge
As a part of this project I was required to design a website to showcase the results of API weather data project (https://github.com/fbrowther/API-Challenge) 

## The website consist of seven pages in total, including:

### (1) A landing page containing the following elements:
    (a) An explanation of the project.
    (b) Links to each visualizations page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

### (2) There are 4 visualization pages, one for each plot (plot 1-4) with the following elements:
    (a) A descriptive title and heading tag.
    (b) The plot or visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs: max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed). 
        The images displayed on these pages are stored in the assets/images folder.
    (c) A paragraph describing the plot and its significance was included.

### (3) A "Comparisons" page:
    (a) It contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can be easily compared with each other.

### (4) Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    (a) The grid has two visualizations across medium and large screens.

### (5) Finally a "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    (a) The data table (data.html) was created from cities.csv file using pandas read_csv; 
    (b) This was followed by its conversion to pandas dataframe, cleaned and then convert it to data.html file using the data.to_html() function.

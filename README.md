# Web-Design-Challenge 

As a part of this project I was required to design a website to showcase the results of API weather data project (https://github.com/fbrowther/API-Challenge) 


# Deployed web appliciation
#### Please visit: https://fbrowther.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/
    

# The website consist of seven pages in total, including:

### (1) A landing page containing the following elements -
    (a) An explanation of the project.
    (b) Links to each visualizations page. 
    (c) A sidebar containing preview images of each plot. 
    (d) Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

### (2) 4 visualization pages, one for each plot (plot 1-4) with the following elements -
    (a) A descriptive title and heading tag.
    (b) A visualization plot for the selected comparison (latitude vs: max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed). 
    (c) The images displayed are stored in the assets/images folder.
    (d) A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

### (3) A "Comparisons" page -
    (a) Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can be easily compared with each other.

### (4) "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations -
    (a) Pandas dataframe created from cities.csv file using pandas read_csv; 
    (b) Pandas dataframe cleaned and converted to data.html file using the data.to_html() function.

### (5) Bootstrap grid for the visualizations -
    (a) The grid has two visualizations across medium and large screens.
